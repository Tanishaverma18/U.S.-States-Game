# 🚀 Project Alert: U.S. States Game with Python! 🐍🗺️
I’m excited to share my latest project where I’ve combined the power of Pandas and the Turtle library to create an interactive U.S. States Game!🐢🐼🎮

## 🔍 How it works:
* You enter the name of a U.S. state, and it instantly appears on the map!<br>
* The game challenges your knowledge of U.S. geography while providing a fun, educational experience.<br>

This project has been a fantastic way to apply Python's data handling capabilities with Pandas, along with the visualization power of Turtle for creating a dynamic, map-based interface.🌟<br>

## 🔧 Key Technologies:
* Python<br>
* Pandas<br>
* Turtle<br>
